# Lightstep Receiver

<!-- status autogenerated section -->
<!-- end autogenerated section -->

This receiver receives spans from the legacy [Lightstep Tracers](https://github.com/lightstep). This
receiver is provided in order to help migrating to OTel Collectors, and to OTel SDKs eventually.

## Getting Started

All that is required to enable the Lightstep receiver is to include it in the
receiver definitions. A protocol can be disabled by simply not specifying it in
the list of protocols (currently only `http` is supported, but gRPC is planned):

```yaml
receivers:
  lightstep:
    protocols:
      http:
```

The following settings are configurable:

- `endpoint` (default = 0.0.0.0:443):
  host:port to which the receiver is going to receive data.

Observe access token information is discarded, and MUST be set accordingly in the respective OTLP exporter.

## Advanced Configuration

Several helper files are leveraged to provide additional capabilities automatically:

- [HTTP server settings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/confighttp/README.md#server-configuration) including CORS
- [TLS and mTLS settings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/configtls/README.md)
