TODO

1. Map SpanKind?
2. Map Span.error (and maybe Span.logs with errors).
3. Do the same parenthood checks as the OT Shim, when having multiple parents, i.e. take the first one with CHILD_OF.
4. Baggage is being currently discarded, but we should use it (somehow).
5. Find all special Tags (e.g. "lightstep.component_name") and think which ones we should map
   (there is already a document about this somewhere).
6. Return the timers properly (so the tracers don't log "Collector response did not include timing info"
8. Baggage in Span/Reference (links) is not used. Should we use it somehow? Is this even shown or saved on the product?
9. Extract the event name as we do for OTel + OT Shim?
10. Is it useful on our side to get empty Resource? Resource information without actual spans, that is.
11. Check the headers, and otherwise reject it?
12. Enable/implement OBSReport
13. ReporterId? ligthstep.guid? How are they used? Can we simply pass them around?
